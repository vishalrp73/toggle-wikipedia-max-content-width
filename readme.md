## Toggle Max-Width Content Button on Wikipedia

`script.js` can be pasted into a new macOS shortcut and then binded to a keyboard shortcut
to quickly toggle the max-width content feature on Wikipedia that shows/hides whitespace
on any Wikipedia page.

For example, you can bind the quick action to the keyboard shortcut of
`CMD+B` and this will run on an active Wikipedia tab.
